# About Pets

## What are pets

Pets are important in MythWarOnline as they play a major role in battle.

Every character is allowed to keep a maximum of 20 pets.

Pets will always be able to level up faster than the characters (they get twice the exp the character received).

There are many ways a pet can be used, depending on its resistance, skills, and attributes.

## Pets Status Screen

### Name  
When you receive a pet, the name is the default given name. You can click the box beside the name and press Enter after typing the name you wish. Note: spaces are not allowed.

### Species  
The class this pet belongs to (Flying, Human, Special, Dragon, Undead, Demon, etc.)

### Level  
The current level of your pet.

### Loyalty  
Default is 100. When it dies during battle it loses 20 loyalty points. When it levels up, it resets to 100.  
If loyalty reaches 40 or below, the pet may not follow your instructions in battle.  
The pet will not run away even at 0 loyalty. Use a loyalty stone to restore it to 100.

### Health  
Current HP / Maximum HP.

### Mana  
Current MP / Maximum MP.

### Attack  
The base damage your pet can inflict on a target.

### Speed  
Determines how fast this pet’s turn comes in battle.

### Exp  
Total experience points your pet has earned at its current level (Current Exp / Exp Needed). At the end of the experience bar is a green number showing the current Growth Rate.

### Stats Point  
Each time your pet levels, you get 4 stat points. Use the **+** / **−** icons to allocate them.

- **Sta** — determines HP  
- **Int** — determines MP and magical damage (if applicable)  
- **Str** — determines Attack  
- **Agi** — determines Speed  

### Battle / UI Buttons

- **Battle** — click to choose which pet to use in battle  
- **Follow** — pet follows you while moving; a pet at max GR will have a shiny effect  
- **Dismiss** — dismiss the pet from service (a confirmation box will appear)  
- **Item** — allow the pet to use an HP/MP potion or item  
- **Confirm** — press to apply stat changes

## Pet Battle Selection

- **Bag** — use an item from your inventory  
- **Defend** — protects a party member or other pet by “jumping in” to take damage

  - *Note*: Pet cannot be changed if you are stunned, chaosed, or hypnotized. Changing pets uses up your turn.
