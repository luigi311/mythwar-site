# Raising Pets Resistance

To increase resistance for pets, you require **CRYSTAL +1 / +2 / +3 / +4 / +5**.  
They are sold at Crystal Seller in Blyton (260, 460) or by killing Spirits in Demon Square and Desert City Pet shop. You can choose whether you would like to **accept or reject** the offered resist.

- Pets can add **+1** at level 30, **+2** at level 50, **+3** at level 70.  
- Reborn pets can add **+4** at levels 1-50, and **+5** at levels 1-70.  
- But if you did **not** add +1, +2, +3 crystals before your pet is reborn, then you must wait until level 50 before you can add +1-+4, and until level 70 for +5.  
- The **maximum resistance** for any stat is **90**. If the total sum (initial + crystal gains) exceeds 90, the system caps it at 90.  
    - E.g. chaos resist: (initial 30) + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 95 → becomes 90.

## Steps to Add Resistance

1. Select the pet you wish to add resistance to and set it to **BATTLE mode**.  
2. Give the crystal to Nexo, Koradji, or Baia.  
3. The NPC will offer you a random resistance. (Refer to the table below to know which type may be offered.)  
4. If the offered resist matches what you intended, **accept** it; your pet’s resistance increases and you may use the next crystal.  
5. Otherwise, **reject** the offer and repeat step 2. **Rejecting still consumes the crystal.**  

> **Tip:** It may take a while (≈ 30 sec or more) before the NPC offers a different resistance.  
> **Note:** You must use +1 before you can use +2, then +3, etc.
