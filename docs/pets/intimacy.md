### Intimacy Gain / Loss Rules

- When a pet levels up, it gains **+40 intimacy points**  
- When the player levels, each pet set in battle gains **+60 intimacy points**  
- A pet gains **+1 intimacy** for every battle it partakes in  
- If a pet **dies** in battle, it **loses –50 intimacy**  
- If the **player dies** (returns to Woodlingor), a pet set in battle loses **–10 intimacy**  
- Intimacy can be increased via **Lucretia Quest** in the Guild HQ  
  - Only **Grade 1 to Grade 5 gems** may be used in that quest  

#### Steps for Lucretia Quest

1. Set the pet you want to gain intimacy to **battle mode**  
2. Talk to **Lucretia** — he will ask you to help him look for gems  
3. Use the **Give (Alt + G)** function to give him a gem  
4. He thanks you, and your pet gains intimacy depending on the gem’s grade. 1 service point is deducted  
5. Repeat step 1 until you reach the desired intimacy  

*Tip:* The **Bag of Magic** (available in the item mall) is popular, as it offers many Grade 5 gems for a relatively low cost (10 per type)

**Note:** Lucretia Quest can raise pet intimacy only up to **50,000**. Once a pet hits 50k, you cannot use that quest to raise intimacy further.

| Gem Grade | Intimacy Gained |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Grade 1   | 7               |
| Grade 2   | 14              |
| Grade 3   | 28              |
| Grade 4   | 56              |
| Grade 5   | 112             |
