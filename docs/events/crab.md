# Crab

Every **Wednesday at 6 PM EST**, **Friday at 3 PM EST**, and **Sunday at 5 PM EST**, the **Crab Pit (Woodlingor 455,554)** event opens and lasts for an hour. Players can enter through the Crab Pit NPC to participate in the event.

Crabbing is a fast way to earn **Redeem Points (RP)**, which can be exchanged for Experience, Gold, or Ores.

## How It Works

### Part A: Roll Dice

- Each players will roll a dice that ranges from **1 to 99**.  
- If you roll above the threshold of **60**, you get to catch crabs.
- If you roll below the threshold, you will have to wait 30 seconds before you can roll again.
- The system will announce: *“Go catch the crabs in the Crab Pit!”* when it’s your turn.


---
### Part B: Catching Crabs

- crabs will continuously spawn around the Crab Pit.  
- For 90 seconds **click the real crabs** to catch them.  
- Beware: **fake crabs** are planted to trick you and waste time.
