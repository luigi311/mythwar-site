# Crab

Every Monday, Wednesday at 7 pm and Friday at 3 pm, the **Crab Pit (Woodlingor)** event opens. Players can enter through the Crab Pit NPC to participate in the event.

Crabbing is a fast way to earn **Redeem Points (RP)**, which can be exchanged for Experience, Gold, or Ores.

---

## How It Works

### Part A: Roll Dice

- For a total of 3 rounds  
- Each round players will roll a dice that ranges from **1 to 33**.  
- The player with the highest roll earns the right to catch crabs, announced by the system.  
- There can be *outrolls*—other players may beat your roll and take the spot.
- The system will announce: *“Go catch the crabs in the Crab Pit!”* when it’s your turn.


---

### Part B: Catching Crabs

- During your turn, crabs will spawn around the Crab Pit.  
- Run and **click the real crabs** to catch them.  
- Beware: **fake crabs** are planted to trick you.
