# Crab/Mimic

Its time to catch some Mimics! For helping catch the mimcs, you will be rewarded with **Redeem Points (RP)**.

Players can enter through the **Mimic Pit (Woodlingor 455,554)** NPC to participate in the event. The event lasts for **1 hour**.

This a fast way to earn **Redeem Points (RP)**, which can be exchanged for Experience, Gold, or Ores.

## How It Works

### Part A: Roll Dice

- The NPC will metion a color that needs to be rolled.  
- You will then need to roll the matching colored dice that ranges from **1 to 99**.  
- If you roll above the threshold of **60**, you get to catch mimics.  
- If you roll below the threshold, you will have to wait 30 seconds before you can roll again.  
- The system will announce when you rolled above the threshold.

### Part B: Catching Mimics

- Mimics will continuously spawn around the Mimic Pit.  
- For 60 seconds **click the mimics** to catch them.  
- Each mimic has a **50% chance** to **not** reward points so catch as many as you can!
