# Forging

## How to Become a Forger

1. Go to **Demon Square** and talk to the **Master Forger**.  
2. Choose which type of forger you want to be. (*Note: if you later switch the type, you’ll lose all forging experience from the previous type.*)  
3. Redeem ores from **Redeem Stewards**, and visit the armoury or weapon shop to get your level 1 equipment.  
4. Bring the equipment + required ores/reagents to the proper **Helper NPC** (e.g. Helmet Helper, Weapon Helper, etc.).  
5. If successful, you gain **1 forging experience point**.
