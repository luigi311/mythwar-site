> ~ adopted from p0rnst4r (Missouri) Shapeshifting guide

## Definition  
In MythWar, players can shapeshift into monsters while gaining those additional attributes. There are a few ways to obtain Shapeshift Potions (SS Potions)

## Obtaining

### Buying  
Talk to **Demanco** in Blyton (186, 520) to buy the Glimmer Fish SS Potion for 200,000 gold.

### Decoting via Gems  
- At **Guild HQ**, talk to the **Alchemist (157, 149)** NPC  
- Choose **Dedoct shapeshifting potion** 
- Use **Give / Alt + G** to give a **G1 – G5 gem** plus **1 service point**  
- Success → you receive a Shapeshift Potion  
- Failure → you can try again (fail rate is quite high)

---

### Hunting for SS Potions

- First, **shapeshift into the monster** whose form holds the potion  
- Then go to the monster’s location and battle. If lucky, you’ll receive the SS potion  
- In a party, the chance is randomized (any party member might get it)


### Shapeshift → Location → Potion 

{{ shapeshift_table() }}
