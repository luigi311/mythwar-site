# Gems

Ever see a player taking just **1 damage** from a monster while you're taking hundreds or thousands? Their secret is **gems**. Gems boost **resistance** (or other stats) depending on the type and how they are used.

## Gem Combination & Conversion

- Use **Gem Master (Blyton 76, 520)** and **Gem Rookie (85, 530)** to combine gems  
- Only same grade + same type gems can be combined → yields a higher grade of that type  
- Failing a combination: you lose one gem but recover the other  
- **Stardust / Perfect Stardust** can increase your success rate  
- **Max gem grade = G-11**

### Conversion to Diamonds

- Gems can be converted **irreversibly** into **Diamonds** via **Gem Converter (Blyton 101, 548)**  
- Diamonds don’t increase resistance; they boost stats: Berserk, Critical, etc.  

| Gem Type                    | Diamond After Conversion |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Black → Black Diamond       | Pierce Rate or Damage    |
| Emerald → Green Diamond     | Combo Rate or Hit        |
| Moonstone → Silver Diamond  | Counter Rate or Damage   |

## Casting Gems / Diamonds into Equipment

- You can **infuse up to 3 gems** into equipment (helmet, armour, weapon, shoes, etc.)  
- If you cast a **higher-grade gem** into equipment that already has gems, it **replaces** the lowest one  
- Equipment that is **infused with essence or reagent** **can not** accept gem casting  
- Resistances on equipment from **Monster** or **Boxes** **can not** be replaced
