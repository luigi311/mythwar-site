## Welcome on this site

Welcome to Thunderized.org, this is an unofficial fansite for MythWar Online. I try to keep this site as up-to-date as possible, but because I quitted this game a while ago I hope everyone can help to report any outdated information.
I'm sorry for not answering mails and questions in the faq, my internet is currently not working. I hope to fix it as soon as possible.
