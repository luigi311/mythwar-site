## Notes & Tips
- If you lose at John, get the **Mushroom Spore** to retry the gambit.  
- The quest is largely narrative / fetch & talk until the final combat.  
- On step 13, when you receive the Soulstone, you immediately get **10k EXP + 2,000 gold** and the **Wanderer** title.  
- After giving the Soulstone back to Elder of Night, **store it** — it later connects you to **Soulstone of Dark** quest chain.
