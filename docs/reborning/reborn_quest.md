## Notes & Tips
- You cannot undertake Reborn until you have completed **all Soulstone quests** and are **level 100**, with **pet lvl 100 in Battle mode**.  
- The key gathering is random monster fights around Burial 4 — persistence is required.  
- Store the final potion in your bank if your character is not ready to reborn immediately.  
- After ingesting the reborn potion, your account resets in certain meaningful ways (see **Reborn Guide**).
