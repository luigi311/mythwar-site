## Battles

### 1) Prince Zenith (Mage) — Desert City (**—**)
![][img-prince-zenith]

- **Prince Zenith (Mage)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Fire, Ice**
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Melee**
    - Notes:
        - This one is not very hard; you can do it without special armor.
        - Best strategy: **Stun** them and kill one by one.
        - **Drain** and **melee** hits work well; mage takes heavy damage from melee.
        - If possible, equip around **50 Fire / 50 Ice resist** for comfort.

---

### 2) Borg Giant (Borg) — Outcast City (**—**)
![][img-borg-giant]

- **Borg Giant (Borg)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **—** (melee only)
    - Strong against: **Melee**
    - Weak against: **Magic**
    - Notes:
        - Strong versus melee, weak versus magic.
        - Hits ~100–200k, sometimes more.
        - The boss and minions are totally **resistant to melee**, so pure melee strategy fails.
        - Minions cast **Repel**, making mages more viable (kamikaze attacks).
        - **Drain, magic, fire, poison** are effective.
        - If Borg is last and **Repel** is active, it may cause **“free teleport”**.
        - Recommended: **70+ melee resist** armor or high dodge set.

- **Minions (Repel / melee)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Repel**, melee
    - Strong against: **Melee**
    - Weak against: **Fire, Magic**

### 3) Dark Knight (Human) — Outcast City (**—**)
![][img-dark-knight]

- **Dark Knight (Male Human)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Chaos IV**
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Melee**
    - Notes:
        - Counters ~6k damage.
        - The knight and mobs can heavily **chaos** your party.

- **Felsworms (×7)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Chaos II**
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Melee**

- **Snake Demons (×2)**

    - Spells used: **—** (melee)
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Melee**
    - Notes: ~1,500 physical

> ### Strategy note:
> This fight is notorious for rampant chaos effects. Even if mobs die easily, players may struggle with status effects. A strong **Chaos resistance build** (especially on Borg) helps. Some players solo this with a STR Borg who hits ~10k on Capilla — no pet needed.

### 4) Worn General (Centaur) — Outcast City (**—**)
![][img-worn-general]

- **Worn General (Male Centaur)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Drain IV**
    - Strong against: **Chaos (immune)**
    - Weak against: **Melee**
    - Notes:
        - Immune to Chaos.
        - Good melee strength; this fight leans melee-friendly.

- **Aurora Lions (×9)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Hypnotize**
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Melee**
    - Notes: Can hit ~20k damage.
        - Suggested to cast **Chaos** on the lions so they fight each other.
        - Mortal melee works well; centaur boss cannot be chaosed.
        - Good **anti-hypno** gear helps avoid being slept mid-battle.

### 5) Princess Agony (Human) — Outcast City (**—**)
![][img-princess-agony]

- **Princess Agony (Female Human)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Frailty IV**
    - Strong against: **Chaos, Stun, Hypno**
    - Weak against: **—**
    - Notes:
        - She **cannot be chaosed, stunned, or hypnotized**.
        - Her **Frailty IV** is a huge threat.

- **Skeletals (×7)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Melee** (~60–70k)
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Stun, Hypno**
    - Notes: These are killable by crowd control (stun/hypno).

- **Glimmer Fish (×2)**
    - Estimated HP: **—**
    - Spells used: **Heal I** (heals ~70k to Skeletals)
    - Strong against: **—**
    - Weak against: **Stun, Hypno**
    - Notes:
        - Fishes heal Skeletals, so leaving them alive prolongs fight.
        - Fish **can be stunned** (but likely not chaosed).
        - Recommended kill order: **Princess → Fish → Skeletals**.

> **Final boss thoughts:**  
> This is widely considered the hardest round.  
> Keep **Skeletals stunned** as much as possible, strike the **Princess**, then finish Fish and remaining Skelets.  
> Be wary of **free teleports** and do your best to mitigate resets.
