# Guild

## Steps

1. **Defeat Devilman** — **Demon Square (364,253)**  
   Recommended to do with party.

2. **Play a game with Devilman** — **Demon Square (364,253)**  
   Click either **Left** or **Right** hand. Guess correctly **3 times** and you’re done. (a few wrong guesses don’t matter.)

3. **Weapon/Armor order list**  
    - With the list in your inventory, go to the **Weaponry/Armory NPC** (start with **Blython**).  
    - If the NPC **doesn’t** offer **half price**, try another city.  
    - The NPC doesn’t have to say “half-price” explicitly—**any discount** qualifies.  
    - Make sure you’re at the correct shop type (**Weapon** vs **Armor**) before handing in.

4. **Clean up HQ**  
   Use the **Broom** (in your inventory) on spots in the HQ. If a spot is already cleaned, move to another and use it again. Repeat until it says stop.

5. **Item searching** — where to find common requests:
    - **Any Groceror**  
        - Devil's Tear  
        - Rose  
        - Crystal Ball
    - **Woodlingor Groceror**  
        - Teleport Scroll (the green leaf)
    - **Woodlingor Herbal Shop**  
        - Apple • Banana • Lychee • Pear
    - **Blython Herbal Shop**  
        - Graded Apple • Graded Banana • Graded Lychee • Graded Pear
    - **Demon Square Herbal Shop**  
        - Red Salad • Wild Lychee
    - **Desert City Herbal Shop**  
        - Banana Sushi • Wild Pear
    - **Tour Agent** *(Outcast City **135,410** is the easiest)*  
        - Small Red Potion • Small Blue Potion

6. **Mystery Quest**  
   A series of monsters (names usually start with **Death …**) found on the **left side of the Woodlingor map**; the last is near **revive**. Check **Alt-Q** (Quest Log) for exact coordinates. A party of **4–5** is enough; EXP is good for the difficulty.
