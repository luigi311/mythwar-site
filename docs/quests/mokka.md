## How it works

1. Talk to the **Disciple** in **Revive Arena** to **activate** the quest. 
2. Fight battles in **Revive Arena** to have a chance to receive the quest item — the **Mokka Sword**
3. **Return the sword** to **Disciple** to receive **100 Skill Points** to your **lowest skill**.

> **Tip:** As long as you **don’t return** the sword yet, you’ll continue to have a chance receive **another**. Keep cycling fights to bank swords, then turn them in until you hit the **3,000 per-skill cap**. If needed, **reactivate** the quest.
