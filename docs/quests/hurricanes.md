> Tip (common pattern from the guide): **H1–H4** are relatively weak for a decent party; from **H5+** expect 10 mobs per fight, heavy drainers, **Heal IV** (~266k per target), and human mobs that are very resistant to **Chaos**.

## How spawning and progression work

1. **Timed spawns:** Each hurricane has a fixed spawn window. If one is defeated in that window, it **despawns** until the **next** cycle (similar to Spirits). 
2. **Order:** You must clear **H1 → H2 → …** in order. If you’ve previously beaten **H10**, you can repeat **any** from **H1–H10** without redoing earlier ones. 
3. **Human-type mobs:** When a mob “dies,” it leaves a tomb; **healers can revive** them with **Heal**, so manage healers first. 
4. **Titles:** Only the **party leader** gets the titles for **H5**, **H10**, and **H14** (no gem for the leader on those title clears). 
5. **Drops:** Gems drop **randomly to individuals** (not to the whole party), unlike Spirit eggs.
