# Hurricanes

## Needs to be updated/validated against osmw


## Summary
- **Task & Type:** Timed world event — progressive battle quest
- **Description:** System-announced hurricanes spawn in fixed order. Human-type mobs revive with heals, chaos is less effective. Rewards include gems, EXP, AODs, and titles.
- **Activate from:** System message / spawn
- **Difficulty:** Scaling (H1–H4 easy, H5+ very hard)
- **Recommended party:** Strong full party

---

## Steps
1. Wait for **system announcement** of a hurricane spawn.  
2. Clear hurricanes **in order** (H1 → H2 → H3 …).  
3. Once you’ve reached a level (e.g. H10), you can replay any up to that point without redoing earlier ones.  
4. Manage healer-type mobs early — they can revive fallen allies with **Heal IV (~266k per target)**.  
5. Titles are awarded only to the **party leader** at H5, H10, and H14.

## Notes
- **H1–H4:** manageable for decent parties.  
- **H5+:** 10 mobs per fight, heavy drainers, human mobs, chaos-resist, strong healers.  
- **Loot:** Gems drop to **random individuals** (not entire party).
