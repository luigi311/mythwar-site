# Drow Lord

Finally reaching **lvl 91**, and looking around Mythwar you realise there are only a few options left which still give considerable experience. And the best option among them is fighting **Drow Lord**. In short, Drow Lord works similarly to the Drowcrusher quest—but there’s a twist: the monsters are **much harder** and **highly resistant to skills**. Also, **there is no limit** to how many you can fight per day.
